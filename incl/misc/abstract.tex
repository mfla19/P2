Linear programming is used to optimize linear programming problems. In this project, different methods for solving linear programming problems are explored. One method explored is the geometric method, in which the level sets are used to find the solution to the problem. The other method is the simplex method. Here, the geometric property of the simplex method is explored and used to deduce the simplex method. The simplex method uses linear algebra to jump between basic solutions, to find the optimal one. This is implemented by the full tabular method, the lexiographic rule and the big M-method. The big M-method is used to solve organizational problems. The found methods are then used to solve a case about a company wanting to optimize their expenses to salary.
